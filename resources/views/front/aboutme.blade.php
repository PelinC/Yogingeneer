            Hello there,
            My name is Pelinsu Çelebi. I was born in August 7,1993 in the very very south of Turkey, Iskenderun (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0skenderun" target="blank">Alexandretta</a>). I lived in that beautiful, magical little town which is famous for its very cosmopolitan population and hospitality against all, and its amazing cuisine until I was 18. Then, I moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara" target="blank">the capital, Ankara </a> to study Industrial Engineering at <a href="https://www.etu.edu.tr/en" target="blank">TOBB University of Economics and Technology</a>. While studying there, it was always my goal to try out experiencing as many future fields I could work in and decide beforehand the one that I love the most. In this search, I have worked as member and coordinator of Student Associations, participated in student competitions in many different subjects from marketing to stochastic modelling or supply chain management. After all these trials, with some luck, some search and unexpected chain of events I found what I loved during my final internship which was Data Science. After my graduation, I decided to pursue this goal further and applied for a MSc in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/" target="blank"> Politecnico di Milano</a> in Italy. And now I am at the end of my studies workin on my thesis on "Debiasing Word Embeddings" and looking for a job.

          <p>Aside from my professional background, I am a huge yoga enthusiast and currently attending a Yoga Teacher Training program. The yoga journey for me started when my doctor suggested it to me to relief my back pain due to moderate scoliosis. After a few weeks from when I started 5 years ago, I fell in love with the practice and found myself making time for it every day gladly and eagerly even if it meant that I had to wake up at 5.00 am. After all these years, now I am on the path to become a teacher as well and planing to share the journey with my blog posts.</p>
